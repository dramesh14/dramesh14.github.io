                   <h3><a target="_blank" class="mdb-5" href="pdf/RameshFolkens_GroupSight_Poster.pdf">System and Methods of Confirming Image Descriptions for use in Hybrid Intelligent Systems</a></h3>
                     <p> Real-time captioning of visual media has a potential for great impact in applications such as helping the visually impaired identify objects and the relationships with their surroundings. Fully automated visual captioning is still in its nascent stages, and hence cannot be used as a reliable solution in such applications. However, automated captioning when combined with human-in-the-loop systems can provide real-time yet reliable solutions. Efficient systems employ algorithmic selection to decide when to include human intelligence. In this study, we propose a novel method to determine the validity of a machine generated caption for a previously unseen image. Our approach utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation based topic models to establish the semantic relatedness between a natural language caption and the objects & attributes present in an image. We show that this method can also be used to decide subsequent actions when employed in human-in-the-loop image caption annotation systems.</p>

                   <h3 class="mdb-5">Quality Control and Reliability of Crowd Workers in Real-time Image Captioning Tasks</h3>
                     <p> Monitorting quality control and reliability of crowdworkers in a non-binary task like image captioning is a challenge as there can be multiple right answers. In this project, we implemented a scheme to compute performance metrics for each crowd worker by considering their quality, accuracy and response times on the task of image captioning. This metric also helped to simultaneously measure the inter-rater reliability between workers.</p>

                          <p>Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) could be a potential solution to many issues related to education. However, the biggest challenge for an ITS is to be able react to students in the same way as a human tutor does. This involves spontaneously adapting and reacting to students’ understanding levels. In our study, we have explored the possibility of using audio-visual cues of students to detect their understanding levels with respect to the response of a human tutor. The analysis has been done on a self-curated and annotated real-classroom interaction dataset instead of acted datasets that are generally used in such studies. We have been able to achieve a baseline accuracy of 62% in classifying the students’ levels of understanding, thus confirming the utility of such multimodal cues in modeling responses of an ITS in a student-ITS interaction.</p>

                            <p>This project investigates the utility of the unsupervised feature learning algorithm for the task of image classification. The state of the art methods for image classification use a pre-learning stage with deep networks to achieve superior results. In this project, one such pre-learning phase has been investigated and found to give significant improvement over the baseline performance obtained using raw pixel data as inputs to a classifier. The main aim of this project was to be able to find the relationship between the different hyper parameters of the feature learning model and the classification performance. This aim has been significantly achieved as is shown by the extensive study carried out in the project.</p>

                              <p>Gender recognition from faces is a popular problem in computer vision as it is useful in many applications such as biometric authentication, high-tech surveillance and security systems, criminology, inspection, augmented reality, etc. Our system first detects the faces appearing in front of the camera using a Viola - Jones object detection framework, and then performs gender classification using a Support Vector Machine classifier that is trained on Local Binary Pattern features. Our system has been implemented on the DaVinci DSP DM6437 from Texas Instruments. We found that we could detect upto 5 faces at a time with an accuracy of 100%. Restricting the facial region to a pre-determined bounding box produces the right gender result with an accuracy of 80%, and an initialization time of 10 frames.</p>
